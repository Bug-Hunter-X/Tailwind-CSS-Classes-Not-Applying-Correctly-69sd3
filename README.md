# Tailwind CSS Styling Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes are not being applied correctly to a React component.  The component renders without any issues, but the expected styling based on the Tailwind classes is not present.

## Bug Description

The component should display a gray background, styled text, and a blue button. However, the actual rendered output lacks the expected styling from Tailwind CSS.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring the Tailwind directives are correctly configured in the project setup, and that the CSS is properly imported or built into the application. Specific issues might include incorrect paths to the CSS, missing build steps, or conflicts with other CSS frameworks.
